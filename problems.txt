Problem 1
=========

Given the following function signature:

    CREATE FUNCTION New_User(_Username text) RETURNS integer

Write a PL/PgSQL function which adds a new user into the Users table and
returns the UserID of the newly created user.  Assume the argument is input
directly from the user, and show a nice error message in the most common error
conditions.


Problem 2
=========

Given the following function signature:

    CREATE FUNCTION New_Deposit(_Username text, _Recipient text, _Amount numeric) RETURNS integer

Write a PL/PgSQL function to carry out a deposit of _Amount from _Username to
_Recipient.  Assume _Recipient and _Amount are input directly from the user,
and show a nice error message in the most common error conditions.  Keep
Users.NetWorth up to date, and don't allow overdrafts.  The necessary amount
must pre-exist on a single account owned by _Username.  If the user has
sufficient funds on multiple accounts, it does not matter which account the
money is taken from.  The return value should be the BankDepositID of the
deposit.

For testing, you can have user 'Richie' send money to 'Gloria'.
